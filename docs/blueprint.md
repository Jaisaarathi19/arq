# **App Name**: ARQ Digital Nexus

## Core Features:

- Hero Section: Implement a full-screen hero section with a subtle, animated 3D background to immediately capture attention.
- About Section: Display ARQ's mission, vision, and key information in a concise and visually appealing 'About' section with scroll-triggered animations.
- Events Showcase: Showcase past events and workshops in a chronologically ordered or horizontally scrollable layout. Each event entry includes a title, date, brief description, and a monochrome image.

## Style Guidelines:

- Strictly adhere to a monochromatic palette using shades of black, white, and grey only, to maintain a futuristic and data-driven aesthetic.
- Accent color: Use a subtle, cool grey-blue (#A7B0C2) as an accent to provide visual highlights without breaking the monochromatic theme.
- Apply bold and attractive typography, using Syne, Orbitron, or Staatliches for headings and Inter, Manrope, or IBM Plex Sans for body text.
- Implement smooth scroll navigation, animated section transitions, and custom cursor effects to enhance the user experience.
- Ensure a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
